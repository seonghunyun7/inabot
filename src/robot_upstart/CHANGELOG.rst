  * Cosmetic
  Remove unnecessary parenthesis.
  * Correct typo
  * FIX: Remove unreachable code
  * Enable customizable After= in service
  This feature enables the user to define the services after which the
  generated service will. This is handy when hardware-related system
  services have to start before the ROS software.

  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers
  [doc] Add systemd start/stop commands.
* Melodic compatibility: modify getifip for bionic output (`#88 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/88>`_)

* [doc] Clarify the logic for automated job name determination. (`#82 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/82>`_)
  Problem addressed
  =================
  When `--job` option is not passed to `rosrun robot_upstart install`, the job name gets determined automatically but the logic of it is not clear.
  Solution to the problem
  =======================
  Add an explanation to the document.
* [CI][kinetic-devel] Update to Xenial. (`#79 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/79>`_)
  * [CI][kinetic-devel] Update to Xenial.
  On a PR https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/pull/78 I saw [CI failure](https://travis-ci.org/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/builds/507510733?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) that seems to be related to platform issue. Using `trusty` for xenial-based job might not work (any more?).
  * [CI] Switch to industrial_ci. Add ROS2 dashing.
  * [CI] Remove ROS2 dashing for now (see https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/pull/79#issuecomment-533908848).
* Add support for wait flag in the install script (`#73 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/73>`_)
* Contributors: Chris I-B, Frederik Mazur Andersen, Isaac I.Y. Saito, Mateusz Sadowski, Mikael Arguedas, Mike Purvis, Ramon Wijnands, Tony Baltovski

------------------
* Add a dependency onto network-online.target (`#67 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/67>`_)
* Clarify the reason of the error due to wrong pkgpath passed. (`#57 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/57>`_)
* Allow ROS_HOME to be set previously by env file. (`#54 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/54>`_)
* Contributors: Isaac I.Y. Saito, Thomas Furfaro, mhosmar-cpr

0.2.0 (2015-03-14)
------------------
* Linter fixes.
* Contributors: Mike Purvis

0.1.2 (2015-03-13)
------------------
* Add some basic install/uninstall tests.
* Add uninstall job method and script.
* Remove out of date README content, now forwards to ROS Wiki and generated documentation.
* Add a documentation section about permissions
* Contributors: GaÃ«l Ecorchard, Mike Purvis

0.1.1 (2015-01-20)
------------------
* Python Rewrite
* The startup event is too early for ROS to start, use local-filesystems instead.
* Remove bash versions of the install and uninstall utilities.
* Add support for supplying the --wait flag to roslaunch.
* Add Sphinx documentation.
  To get the argparse docs required moving most of the install
  script to a module, which probably should have been done anyway.
* Add a new-implementation install script, refactor Provider to be a class rather than function.
* Add roslint.
* Initial implementation of Python job generator.
* Port templated files to use empy.
  This gets rid of the bespoke templating system that was so bad. Also
  notable here is adding a --root flag to install somewhere other than
  the actual root. This needs to be further fleshed out, for example
  by not reinvoking with sudo when installing to non-root location.
* use LANG=C for ifconfig
* add argument to specify log directory
